## GIS Data

This repo consists of a number of shapefiles I've collected around the web,
mostly from state & muni sites for a project.

The focus for me is around LA (city & county).

The files:

Bottleneck2012 : traffic data from caltrans
DRP_AIRPORTS : airport locations in LA county (from county)
DRP_HIGHWAY_PLAN : highways in LA county (from county)
lacounty_airport_runways : runway maps of la county
LMS_Data_20140707.gdb : points of interest in LA (from county)

la_city.shp : maps from LA Times
la_county.shp : maps from LA Times

shn2014_ln : state highway master plan (from caltrans)
shn2014_pm : state highway master plan (from caltrans)
